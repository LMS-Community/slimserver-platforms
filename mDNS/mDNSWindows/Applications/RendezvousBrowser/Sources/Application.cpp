        Revision 1.1  2003/07/18 19:41:54  dean
        Initial revision

        Revision 1.1  2003/01/20 00:45:58  blackketter
        Adding support for advertising the SLIMP3 via zeroconf/mDNS/Rendezvous.

        Debugging via --d_mdns

        Requires a binary executable installed to be fork/exec'ed off for each
        instance advertised.  Need to add an option for disabling it.

        It advertises the web interface, the HTTP automation interface (which are
        the same now) and the CLI.  The latter two are _slimdevices_slimp3_http._tcp
        and _slimdevices_slimp3_cli._tcp respectively.

        This uses the Apple open source implementation of the mDNS
        command-line application mDNSResponderPosix.

        This source is included so folks can build the other posix implementations.
        Windows, as always, will require more work.

        Rumor has it that there will be a CPAN module for zeroconf, which would obsolete
        this implementation if pulled in.  That's ok, we'll take it out in that case.

        This introduces a new directory in slimp3/server which is bin.  bin contains
        subdirectories for each supported platform and is where we'd put executables
        we use (similar to the lib/CPAN arrangement.)

        Also added the submitted patch for ogginfo support. This gives ogg files the
        opportunity to be browsed by meta information.  This requires several ogg
        executables to be installed in the default path, which is too hard for the
        average user.  This should also be cleaned up.

        The Ogg patch also included a fix to make ogg files work with spaces in the
        filename.

        Tweaked the comments for the fix that Rob Moser added when I broke hiding
        . and .. on Win32 systems.

        Revision 1.3  2002/09/21 20:44:55  zarzycki
        Added APSL info

        Revision 1.2  2002/09/20 08:37:34  bradley
        Increased the DNS record cache from the default of 64 to 512 entries for larger networks.
