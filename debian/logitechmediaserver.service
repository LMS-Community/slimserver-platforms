[Unit]

Description=Logitech Media Server

# Ensures LMS is shutdown before network. And that the network service
# has at least been started.

After=network.target

# Make LMS wait for network-online.target (if it gets started).
# See notes below.

After=network-online.target

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Some notes on networking targets:
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# We leave it to the user to specify 'Wants=network-online.target' if he
# chooses, because it may not suit all users. But we specify
# 'After=network-online.target' because the SysV init script has
# essentially behaved that way by virtue of the 'Required-Start: $all'
# stanza included within it.
# This is also the approach taken in Debian's & Ubuntu's implementation
# of 'rc.local.service'.
#
# On systemd >= 217, user might execute:
#   'systemctl add-wants logitechmediaserver.service network-online.target'
#
# The effects of the 'After' and 'Wants' 'network-online' stanzas are
# very system dependent. They may or may not ensure that LMS starts up
# after network connections have been established, and they may or may
# not cause a delay in LMS start up.
#
# 'After=network-online.target' schedules LMS to start after the network
# is fully up, whatever that may mean. But it is only effective if the
# 'network-online.target' is active and, even then, it is only effective
# if the user's system has been, or can be, configured to wait
# appropriately for network connections to be established before
# reaching this target.
#
# 'Wants=network-online.target' would activate (pull in) that target.

[Service]

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set start up parameters, essentially replicating the SysV init script.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use of '/etc/default/logitechmediaserver' to set start up parameters
# is supported, for consistency with the init script.
# But setting 'SLIMUSER' is not supported. This unit file will always
# start LMS as user 'squeezeboxserver'.
# The user may override that, the methods available depend on the
# installed version of systemd.

# Note one consequence of this approach: LMS can now see environment
# variables that correspond to the start up parameters, should it choose
# to look (it doesn't at present). This behaviour is an artefact of the
# approach adopted by this unit file and may well change. It should not
# be relied upon in any way.

# Set PATH - same value as set by SysV init script.

Environment="PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"

# Default run time settings. These are used as arguments to LMS when it
# is launched.

Environment="LOGDIR=/var/log/squeezeboxserver/"
Environment="PREFSDIR=/var/lib/squeezeboxserver/prefs"
Environment="CACHEDIR=/var/lib/squeezeboxserver/cache"
Environment="CHARSET=utf8"

# Supplementary run time settings may be defined in
# '/etc/default/logitechmediaserver'. Entries made here would override
# the defaults defined above.

EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/logitechmediaserver

#
# If you want to add additional options use
#    /usr/sbin/squeezeboxserver --help
# for the supported options and place them into the file:
#    /etc/default/logitechmediaserver.
# For example:
#    SLIMOPTIONS="--failsafe --nomysqueezebox"
#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set up user and logging.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Remark: User can't be parameterized in a unit file. We could choose to
# run LMS as root, and pass the USER option to it. But that adds
# unnecessary risk.

User=squeezeboxserver

# LMS will fail to start if a writeable log directory does not exist and
# it cannot create it. This can easily happen where '/var/log' is
# mounted on a temporary file system and requires root permissions to
# create.
# This stanza instructs systemd to create the standard directory
# '/var/log/squeezeboxserver' if it does not exist, with appropriate
# permissions and ownership.
# The user may specify a different directory by setting the 'LOGDIR'
# run time variable, but it is then his responsibility to ensure that
# it exists and is writeable.
# Note: Only effective in systemd >= 235. Earlier releases will see
# harmless 'Unknown lvalue' messages logged.

LogsDirectory=squeezeboxserver
LogsDirectoryMode=0755

# Since we launch LMS in the foreground (ie not daemonized) logs are
# mirrored on stdout. Systemd normally processes logs on stdout, but
# since LMS has its own logging framework we tell systemd to ignore
# the stdout logs and skip log processing.

# We want LMS to handle SIGPIPE, as it can help terminate misbehaving

# LMS is stable. So we don't want systemd to restart it if it fails.
# That just obscures errors.

Restart=no

# We do not instruct LMS to daemonize with the '--daemon' option,
# systemd prefers that we don't. We need 'Type=simple', or 'Type=exec'.

# Type currently defaults to 'simple', but may usefully default to
# 'exec' in future ('exec' available in systemd >= 240). So left unset.

#Type=simple
